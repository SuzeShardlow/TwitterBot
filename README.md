# TwitterBot

![The original doge](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5f/Original_Doge_meme.jpg)

This is a bot that looks for the keyword "doge" in two tweets and replies to both those tweets with the message "Doges are very fun." with a delay of five seconds between the replies.

To run this bot, you will need to create an app using your Twitter account and add your keys into the code at lines 8, 9, 10 and 11 in `app.js` (my keys are secret).

You can set up an app here: https://apps.twitter.com/app/new.

As well as the files above, you will need to download Node.js.  In the directory containing the app files, run `npm install`.

To run the bot, type `node app.js`.

Have fun!
